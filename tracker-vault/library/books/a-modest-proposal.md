> [!IMPORTANT] Summary
> **A Modest Proposal** presents a satirical solution to Ireland's severe poverty by suggesting that impoverished Irish parents sell their children as food to the wealthy. The essay adopts a serious tone, using economic reasoning to argue that this would benefit the poor, reduce the number of impoverished, and provide a new culinary delicacy. Through this grotesque suggestion, the author critiques British colonial policies and the exploitation of the Irish populace.
> 
> The work employs irony and hyperbole to highlight the dehumanization of the poor and the moral indifference of the ruling class. By presenting an absurd proposal in a rational manner, it underscores the urgent need for genuine social reform and compassion. The essay remains a powerful example of satirical writing, challenging readers to reflect on societal injustices and the value of human life.
