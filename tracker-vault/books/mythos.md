**Prometheus** sculpts the beings, **Gaia**'s clay creates them, **Zeus**'s spit holds them together, **Apollo**'s fire (Sun) was bakes them and **Athena**'s breath gave them life  
The mortal beings where called **Anthropos**  

#### The Golden Age

The beings were free to do whatever and go wherever they liked 
But they where forbidden from learning to create **fire**  

Life was simple at this time, there was so famine, poverty or diseases  
Prometheus liked the humans the most and spend a lot of time with them  
He was saddened that the lack of fire would not allow them to progress and evolve  

Prometheus scaled Mount Skolio and from Hephaestus forge stole fire by concealing it in a giant fennel stalk  
Zeus was angry with Prometheus and the humans and punished them  

#### The Punishments

Zeus had Hephaestus create a female into whom life was breath by **Aphrodite**  
Some of the Gods joined in to confer upon the female notable talents  
The female was named All-Gifted (**Pandora**)  
Pandora was given a container (jar) which Zeus told should never be opened 

Pandora was married to **Epimetheus** (Prometheus's brother)  
One day Pandora could not resist her urge so she opened the jar  
She unleashed on the world Illness, Violence, Deiced, Misery and Want  

The creatures that where freed from the jar where - Ponos (Hardship), Limos (Starvation), Algos (Pain), Dysnomia (Anarchy), Pseudea (Lies), Neikea (Quarrels), Amphelogiai (Disputes), Makhai (Wars), Hysminai (Battles), Androktasiai (Manslaughter) and Phonoi (Murder)  
There where the descendants of the dark and evil children of Nyx and Erebus  
When Pandora closed the jar hastily she imprisoned forever Elpis (Hope)  

| Parent     | Mother          | Children      |
| :--------- | :-------------- | :------------ |
| Epimetheus | Pandora         | Pyrrha        |
| Prometheus | Clymeme/Hesione | Deucalion<br> |

Lycaon was one of the original clay humans created by Prometheus  
**Lycaon** killed his own son **Nyctimus** and offered it as a sacrifice to the Gods  
Zeus revoted by this brought the boy back to life and turned Lycaon into a wolf  
Lycaons sons rules with extreme violence and behaved in a very disgusting manner  
Zeus causes a flood which killed everyone in Greece and the Mediterranean region  

**Pyrrha** & **Deculian** survived the flood went to Delphi to consult the oracle **Themis**  
Themis instructed them to throw the bones of their Mother over their shoulder if they wanted to have decedents  
They throw stones and the place where the stones feel gave rise to a new generation of men and women  

The new generation because of the plague unleashed by Pandora were not immortal and had to deal with the inevitability of death  

Hermes was given the task of escorting the souls of important death people to hades the rest was taken by **Thanatos** (Death)  
They would bring the souls of the people to the cavern where the River Styx and River Acheron meet were Charon would ferry them to Hades  
If the dead could not have payment, Charon make they souls wait for 1000 years before they were offered safe passage  

The task of weighing the souls of the death (Judge of the Underworld) was assigned to **Minos** and **Rhadamanthus** along with their half brother **Aeacus**

Hero's, Righteous and ones with divine blood were transferred to Elysian Fields  
The souls of the ones who were reincarnated three times and still lived a virtues life was transferred to the Isles of Blessed  
The Blameless and ordinary where transferred to the Meadows of Asphodel were they would send their eternity. These souls were granted a pleasant enough afterlife. They drank from River Lethe (forgetfulness) so they could spend their eternity without remembering their life on earth  
The least of the sinners were forced to spend their eternity in the halls of Hades without any feeling, strength or consciousness  
The worst of the sinners where sent to the Field of Punishment were they are forced to bear punishment for their crimes for eternity  

The Silver age still had gods, demigods and all other kinds of immortals

Zeus was furious to see that some of the humans had survived and had started a new civilization. He finally decided to punish Prometheus. To was taken to Caucasus Mountains were the Cyclopes were present he was chained to the mountain with unbreakable iron. Every day vultures would come and eat his liver this was his punishment for eternity
